                <p> During the cruise 2022 collections in June, Jisoo gave fans a thrill at Dior's destination show at Greece's Panathenaic Stadium
                    by offering a preview of Maria Grazia Chiuri's collection moments before it hit the runway. Her refined white linen dress, paired with the brand's hybrid sneaker-ankle boots, captured the mood of Chiuri's show. </p>

                <p> At Chanel's spring 2022 ready-to-wear collection, Jennie returned to the front row in a look that highlighted everything young and playful about the 111-year-old house. Sure, she could have worn 
                    a little black jacket, but Jennie's red tweed mini-skirt and matching cropped vest were non-stop. Styled to the hilt with multiple double-C necklaces. </p>

                <p> Ros√© kept things interesting with multiple standout moments, including the launch of her debut single 'On the Ground' and its fashion-filled music video, which featured looks from Alex Perry, Re/Done,
                    and of course Saint Laurent. A muse for designer Anthony Vaccarello, she joined him at the Met Gala is one of the night's most appealing looks: a slinky LBD amplified by the addition of an oversized 
                    white bow. </p>

                <p> No BlackPink discussion would be complete without the group's rapper, Lisa, who cemented her status as queen of the daily outfit post. Even with the launch of her solo EP Lalisa to contend with, she still found time to 
                    maintain one of the most compelling Instagram feeds around. Filled with plenty of glimpses at Hedi Slimane's latest Celine offerings, behind-the-scenes sneak peeks at the life of a pop superstar. </p>
